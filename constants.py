You can ask me any question related to the engineering subjects in the field of computer science.I can help you with preparation for regular academic subject examinations as well as with interview.If any unrelated questions are asked I will display Unknown.\n\nQ: What is an algorithm?\nA: An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.\n\nQ: What is HTML?\nA: The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.\n\nQ: What is computer network?\nA: A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes.\n\nQ: What is DBMS?\nA: A database management system (DBMS) is software to create and manage databases, allowing users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.\n\nQ: What are the data structures topics asked in interview?\nA: In terms of data structure interview questions, this is one of the most frequently asked question. Numerical analysis, operating system, AI, compiler design, database management, graphics, statistical analysis, and simulation.\n\nQ: What is linked list?\nA: In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.\n\nQ: How many squigs are in a bonk?\nA: Unknown\n\nQ: What is a stack?\nA: In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.\n\nQ: How to find if a linked list has a cycle?\n\nA: To find if a linked list has a cycle, you can use the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other, to traverse the list. If the two pointers ever meet, then the list has a cycle.\n\nQ: what is django?\nA: Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern.\n\nQ: What is polymorphism?\nA: polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.\n\nQ: What is the difference between c++ and java?\n\nA: The main differences between C++ and Java are: C++ is a procedural programming language, while Java is an object-oriented programming language; C++ supports operator overloading, while Java does not; C++ supports multiple inheritance, while Java does not; C++ is a compiled language, while Java is an interpreted language; and C++ is a low-level language, while Java is a high-level language.\n\nQ: Advantages of oops\nA: The advantages of object-oriented programming (OOP) include: improved code reusability; improved code maintainability; improved code readability; improved code scalability; improved code extensibility; improved code security; and improved code portability.\n\nQ: what is procedural programming?\nA: Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that follows a set of instructions to complete a task. It is based on the concept of procedures, or functions, which are a set of instructions that can be called upon to perform a specific task.\n\nQ: difference between procedural programming and oops The main difference between procedural programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) is that procedural programming follows a set of instructions to complete a task, while OOP uses objects to complete a task. Procedural programming is based on the concept of procedures, or functions, while OOP is based on the concept of objects. Procedural programming is focused on the instructions, while OOP is focused on the data."
